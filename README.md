# Approximation-Techniques-With-MATLAB-
This repository contains companion code which complements the paper "Approximation Techniques with MATLAB" published in the Dolomites Research Notes on Approximation Journal. It contains the following sections:

- Function approximation
  - uniform approximation with Bernstein polynomials and BÃ©zier curves
  - L^2-approximation with Jacobi orthogonal polynomials and Fourier series 
- Wavelets Analysis in L^2(R)
  - Continuous and Discrete Wavelet Transform 
  - Multiresolution Analysis
- Radial Basis Functions
  - Scattered data interpolation
  - Surrogate Global Optimization with cubic RBF
  - Support Vector Machines with RBF kernels
- Neural Networks 
  - universal approximators
  - approximation of the dynamic state of an Extended Kalman Filter.
